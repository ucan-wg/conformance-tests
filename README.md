## Installation

### Using `cargo`

```console
cargo install ucan-fixture-generator
```

## Testing the Project

- Run tests

  ```console
  cargo test
  ```

## Contributing

:balloon: We're thankful for any feedback and help in improving our project!
We have a [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you get involved. We
also adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Nix

This repository contains a [Nix flake][nix-flake] that initiates both the Rust
toolchain set in [rust-toolchain.toml](./rust-toolchain.toml) and a
[pre-commit hook](#pre-commit-hook). It also installs helpful cargo binaries for
development. Please install [nix][nix] and [direnv][direnv] to get started.

Run `nix develop` or `direnv allow` to load the `devShell` flake output,
according to your preference.

### Formatting

For formatting Rust in particular, we automatically format on `nightly`, as it
uses specific nightly features we recommend by default.

### Pre-commit Hook

This project recommends using [pre-commit][pre-commit] for running pre-commit
hooks. Please run this before every commit and/or push.

- If you are doing interim commits locally, and for some reason if you _don't_
  want pre-commit hooks to fire, you can run
  `git commit -a -m "Your message here" --no-verify`.

### Recommended Development Flow

- We recommend leveraging [cargo-watch][cargo-watch],
  [cargo-expand][cargo-expand] and [irust][irust] for Rust development.
- We recommend using [cargo-udeps][cargo-udeps] for removing unused dependencies
  before commits and pull-requests.

### Conventional Commits

This project *lightly* follows the [Conventional Commits
convention][commit-spec-site] to help explain
commit history and tie in with our release process. The full specification
can be found [here][commit-spec]. We recommend prefixing your commits with
a type of `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `ci`, `refactor`, etc..., structured like so:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Getting Help

For usage questions, usecases, or issues please open an issue in our repository.

We would be happy to try to answer your question or try opening a new issue on Github.
